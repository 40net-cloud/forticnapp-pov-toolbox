# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS: Agentless Workload Scanning (AWLS)


## üß† Why Agentless Workload Scanning ?

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Overview** | **Agentless Workload Scanning (AWLS)** provides comprehensive visibility into **vulnerability risks** and **secrets** across your cloud workloads ‚Äî without installing agents. |
| **Flexibility & Coverage** | Offers broad scanning capabilities for both **hosts** and **container images**, including:<br>‚Ä¢ Scanning **running containers**<br>‚Ä¢ Scanning **images stored on disk** |
| **Key Benefits** | ‚Ä¢ Gain insight into **CVEs** on hosts and containers.<br>‚Ä¢ Eliminate the need to install or manage agents.<br>‚Ä¢ Maintain **private-by-design** scanning within your own AWS environment.<br>‚Ä¢ Improve coverage for **container and host vulnerability detection**. |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note** | ‚Ä¢ **AWLS does not provide workload activity monitoring.**<br>‚Ä¢ To gain full runtime visibility and behavioral analytics, you must also deploy the **FortiCNAPP Agent**.<br>‚Ä¢ Agentless is **complementary** to the agent ‚Äî designed to **co-exist**, not replace it. |
| üßæ **Supported Operating Systems (Linux & macOS)** | [View Documentation ‚Üí](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticnapp/latest/administration-guide/671486)<br>Lists supported Linux distributions and macOS versions for FortiCNAPP agent and agentless workload scanning. |
| ü™ü **Agentless Scanning for Windows** | [View Documentation ‚Üí](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticnapp/latest/administration-guide/838971/agentless-scanning-for-windows)<br>Details supported Windows operating systems for agentless workload scanning. |
| üß† **Host OS and Language Library Support for Vulnerability Assessment** | [View Documentation ‚Üí](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticnapp/latest/administration-guide/999307/host-os-and-language-library-support-for-vulnerability-assessment#supported-linux-operating-systems-packages-and-language-libraries)<br>Reference list of supported operating systems, packages, and language libraries used in FortiCNAPP vulnerability assessments. |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS & FortiCNAPP Agentless Workload Scanning- AWLS Terraform Prerequisites

| Component / Requirement | Description | Reference / Link |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| üë©‚Äçüíª **AWS Account Admin** | Administrative privileges on each AWS account. Required during onboarding process only. | ‚Äî |
| üßæ **AWS Service Quotas** | Ensure that your AWS account has sufficient **Service Quotas** to create and support the required resources in each selected region. This includes quotas for **ECS**, **VPC**, and **Internet Gateways**. | ‚Äî |
| üîß **AWS CLI** | Install and configure the AWS CLI to connect to your AWS Account. | [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) |
| üß∞ **Linux Tools** | Ensure basic tools (`curl`, `git`, `unzip`) are available in the system `PATH`. | ‚Äî |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Terraform** | Install Terraform if not already configured. | [Terraform Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs) |
| üß† **FortiCNAPP CLI** | Open-source CLI tool written in Golang. Available for **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**. Used to interact with FortiCNAPP via the command line. | [FortiCNAPP CLI Guide](https://forticonapp.docs.fortinet.com/cli-guide) |
| ‚ö° **Deployment Methods** | Supported installation environments and automation options:<br>‚Ä¢ **AWS Cloud Shell**<br>‚Ä¢ **Hosts Supported by Terraform** | ‚Äî |

## üöÄ How AWLS Is Deployed
### üîß Configuration Flow (Enabling AWS AWLS Only)
In this setup, **Terraform** is used via the **FortiCNAPP CLI** to deploy a **multi-regional, single-account** or **multi-account** environment.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**
>
> Before you start, make sure you have both:
>
> - üü¶ **AWS Profile** ‚Äî for your **AWS account integration**
> - üü© **FortiCNAPP (Lacework) Profile** ‚Äî for your **FortiCNAPP tenant integration**
>
> üìò For setup instructions and configuration details, refer to the  
> **[Main AWS Folder `README.md`](../README.md)** file.


### üß© Configure AWS Cloud Account Integration

Run the following command to generate your AWS cloud account integration using the **FortiCNAPP (Lacework) CLI**:

```bash
lacework generate cloud-account aws
```

or explicitly specify the FortiCNAPP CLI profile (optional for default but required for other profile or multi-profile created ):
```bash
lacework generate cloud-account aws --profile default
```

## üß© What Is Deployed?

## üõ°Ô∏è Private-by-Design: Agentless Workflow

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1** | The customer runs the **Agentless AWLS Terraform module** to deploy the required resources in their AWS environment. |
| **2** | Terraform template provisions:<br>‚Ä¢ **IAM Roles**<br>‚Ä¢ **S3 Bucket**<br>‚Ä¢ **ECS Cluster** (with *Sidekick* container)<br>‚Ä¢ **VPC**, **Subnet**, and **Internet Gateway** per region |
| **3** | The **Sidekick container** is executed as part of an **ECS Fargate task**. |
| **4** | The task enumerates customer workloads, identifies attached block volumes, securely mounts them, and initiates the scanning process. |
| **5** | Scanning results are written to the customer‚Äôs **S3 bucket**. |
| **6** | **FortiCNAPP** reads metadata and scan results from the customer‚Äôs **S3 bucket** for further processing. |
| üßπ **Automatic Cleanup** | The scanner periodically removes **old snapshots** and **stale scan tasks** to maintain efficiency. |
| ‚è±Ô∏è **Scan Frequency** | By default, scans run **every 24 hours**. |
| üîí **Privacy-First Design** | **FortiCNAPP** has **no direct access** to customer workloads ‚Äî it interacts only with the resources it deploys, using **limited IAM permissions**. |
| üéØ **Selective Scanning** | You can limit the scanned hosts using an explicit **query filter**. By default, all workloads are scanned. |
| üê≥ **Powered by ECS** | *Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)* is a fully managed container orchestration service that simplifies deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. |
