## üß© What Is Deployed in a Workflow + Definitions ?  




## üß† FortiCNAPP AWS Integrations Overview

FortiCNAPP connects to AWS through a secure cross-account role to collect **configuration**, **identity**, and **activity** data.  
The following integrations ‚Äî **CSPM**, **CloudTrail**, and **CIEM** ‚Äî work together to deliver unified visibility and risk analysis across your AWS environment.

---

### üß© Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) ‚Äî Configuration Scanning

| **Aspect** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Provides visibility into cloud misconfigurations, security risks, and compliance posture across AWS resources. |
| **Data Source** | AWS Config, EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, and other resource APIs (read via the Lacework/FortiCNAPP cross-account IAM role). |
| **Workflow** | FortiCNAPP uses the IAM role to **read resource configurations** and analyze posture against security best practices and compliance frameworks (CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS, ISO). |
| **Findings** | Detects issues like public S3 buckets, open security groups, disabled encryption, unused keys, and noncompliant configurations. |
| **Outcome** | Continuous configuration visibility and automated compliance posture scoring per AWS account and region. |

---

### üìú CloudTrail Integration ‚Äî Activity & Event Monitoring

| **Aspect** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Collects and analyzes AWS account activity for anomaly detection, behavioral analysis, and forensic visibility. |
| **Data Source** | AWS CloudTrail |
| **Workflow** | CloudTrail delivers logs to S3 ‚Üí triggers SNS ‚Üí sends messages to SQS ‚Üí FortiCNAPP polls SQS to read new log file details ‚Üí then fetches CloudTrail data from S3 for analysis. |
| **Findings** | Detects suspicious API calls, unauthorized changes, and unusual activity patterns in AWS accounts. |
| **Outcome** | Provides a real-time feed of AWS API activity correlated with configuration and identity data for deep event-based analysis. |

---

### üîê Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) ‚Äî AWS Identity Analysis

| **Aspect** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Analyzes AWS IAM users, roles, and policies to identify over-permissions, risky access, and privilege escalation paths. |
| **Data Source** | AWS IAM, AWS Organizations, AWS Config, and CloudTrail (for identity activity correlation). |
| **Workflow** | FortiCNAPP uses the IAM role to read IAM configurations and correlates that with CloudTrail data to build an **identity graph** showing relationships between users, roles, and permissions. |
| **Findings** | Detects unused roles, overly permissive policies (`*:*`), cross-account trust, orphaned users, and privilege escalation opportunities. |
| **Outcome** | Provides complete IAM visibility, access path analysis, and least-privilege recommendations to strengthen identity security posture. |

---

### üß© Combined Value

Together, these integrations enable:
- Unified visibility into **cloud configuration**, **activity**, and **identity risk**.  
- **Agentless monitoring** using the same AWS cross-account role.  
- Correlation between **who did what**, **where**, and **how** in the AWS environment.  
- Automated compliance and continuous cloud security assurance.
