# Deploying FortiCNAPP Linux Agent using Lacework PowerShell Script (POV) on hosts:

The Lacework FortiCNAPP Linux agent provides threat detection, file integrity monitoring, vulnerability detection, and host-based intrusion detection for your cloud or on-premise Linux OS-based workloads.
After you install the agent, the agent and Lacework FortiCNAPP server communicate with each other. The agent scans your host and securely forwards select metadata to the server to build a baseline of normal behavior. From this, Lacework FortiCNAPP provides alerts for anomalous behavior.

### ⚙️ Agent Consumptions

#### ✅ 1. Create New Agent Access Token:

- Lacework FortiCNAPP Console, go to Settings > Configuration > Agent Tokens.
- Add Name and Description.
- Select Linux as the Operating System.
- Click Save to create your new access token for Linux agent.
  
* Note: An access token can be re-used for multiple agent installations.

#### ✅ 2. Install Using Lacework Script via FortiCNAPP Console:
 In the Lacework FortiCNAPP Console, go to Settings > Configuration > Agent Tokens.
- Select = the Linux access token created and that you want to use for your agent installation.
- Click the Install tab.
- Click  installation method, "Lacework Script":
- Copy URL
  
#### ✅ 3.1. Deployment using Lacework Script:

 -  Open Linux terminal.
 -  wget and Paste URL(from step 2) on the Linux Machine.
 -  sudo sh install.sh

```bash
wget https://x.lacework.net/mgr/v1/download/1162e0f6cf22890b4242c00ce2a725c11341136575d77e23c1311566/install.sh
sudo sh install.sh
```
Run the following command to verify the agent process (datacollector) status:
```bash
sudo /var/lib/lacework/datacollector -status
```

#### ✅ 3.2. Deployment using Lacework Script (With Proxy Settings):
Specify the HTTP or SOCKS proxy server for the Lacework FortiCNAPP agent to use as a network proxy 

| **Scenario**             | **Example**                                     | **Description**                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Standard proxy (no auth) | `http://proxy.company.com:8080`                 | Uses a basic proxy without authentication. |
| Proxy with credentials   | `http://user123:pass456@proxy.company.com:8080` | Connects using authentication credentials. |
| SOCKS proxy              | `socks5://proxy.company.com:1080`               | Example using a SOCKS5 proxy protocol.     |

💡 Tip:
Before applying your configuration in production, verify the proxy connection and credentials.
You can test connectivity with commands like:

```bash
curl -v --proxy http://Your_Proxy_Server:Your_Port https://example.com
```

You can add this on the FortiCNAPP UI Agent Configure Settings.

#### ✅ 4.1. Verify, Start, Stop, Restart, Troubleshoot: C:\Users\Administrator>

The Lacework FortiCNAPP Linux agent service is named datacollector. Once installed, you can use Linux utilities like service, initctl, or systemctl can to manage the service. Common commands are:  

Run the following command to verify the agent process (datacollector) status:
```bash
sudo /var/lib/lacework/datacollector -status
```
```bash
systemctl [start | stop | restart] datacollector
```
```bash
service datacollector [start | stop | restart]
```
```bash
initctl [start | stop | restart] datacollector
```

You can use the following package-specific commands to remove all files, including the configuration and log files created by the agent.  
```bash
apt purge lacework
dpkg --purge lacework
rpm -e lacework
yum remove lacework
```

## 🔍 FortiCNAPP / Lacework Agent Commands (Linux)

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `sudo tail -n 200 /var/log/lacework/datacollector.log` | Displays the last 200 lines of the Lacework agent log file. Useful for quick troubleshooting and reviewing recent activity/errors. |
| `sudo tail -f /var/log/lacework/datacollector.log` | Continuously streams (live view) the Lacework agent logs in real-time. Ideal for monitoring events, debugging, and observing agent behavior as it runs. |
| `sudo /var/lib/lacework/datacollector -status` | Checks the current status of the Lacework agent (datacollector), including whether it is running and healthy. |
| `sudo systemctl restart datacollector` | Restarts the Lacework agent service. Use this after configuration changes or if the agent becomes unresponsive. |
